# masscan-nmap-auto
masscan-nmap-auto is an automated Python script that combines the speed of masscan for rapid port discovery with the detailed service enumeration capabilities of Nmap. It efficiently scans large networks or lists of hosts, detects open ports, and performs targeted service/version detection only on those ports, saving time and bandwidth.
